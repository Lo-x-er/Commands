Some info:

1. If you want to spawn a vehicle, you need to use the name from the game files.
   Example: Oppressor Mk II = oppressor2
   You can use this site to get the name: https://www.gtabase.com/grand-theft-auto-v/vehicles (After selecting the vehicle, find "MODEL ID")

2. Some commands like vehicle commands will only work if you are near me. The "/spawn" command should always work.

3. Most commands with "/" that you want to use on yourself do not require <player>.
   Example:
   For yourself:
    /kill <player> (/kill <player who will be killed>)
    /spawnrandom <vehicle>
   For other player:
    /kill <player> <player> (/kill <player who will be killed> <player who kills him>)
    /spawnrandom <player> <vehicle>

5. Some commands should work if you use "/" instead of "!" and vice versa. You may then get false notifications in game chat. Please pay attention to this.
